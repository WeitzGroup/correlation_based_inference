Code for: Correlations, interactions, and predictability in virus-microbe networks.
=============================

This code uses correlations and time-delayed correlations to predict interactions in virus-microbe communities. 
Interaction networks and time-series are generated in silico.

To characterize the nestedness and modularity of the interaction networks, the BiMaT package (Flores et al, 2015; [http://bimat.github.io/](http://bimat.github.io/)) is included. 
The BiMat package is required for the functions generate_networks and generate_pars.
