Notes on using LSA
Ashley Coenen, 2/8/2018


Command line

For basic use
$ lsa_compute [inputFile] [outputFile]

For some reason LSA defaults to choosing 4 sample timepoints. To force LSA to use all S available timepoints set spotNum=S
$ lsa_compute -s S [inputFile] [outputFile]

LSA is usually fine guessing the number of replicates but repNum=R can be set manually
$ lsa_compute -r R [inputFile] [outputFile]

To set maximum allowed delay D set delayLimit=D (default 3)
$ lsa_compute -d D [inputFile] [outputFile]

To cut down on computation time, set bootstrapping B=0 and permutations P=1
$ lsa_compute -b 0 -x 1 [inputFile] [outputFile]

computation time ~ (B+P)*F^2*N
B = bootstrap #
P = permutation #
F = # of 'factors' or distinct time series
N = # of sample timepoints


File formats

Input file should be .txt or .csv with rows=variables and columns=time:
#F\T	t1	t2	t3
f1
f2
f3
Header row = timepoint labels. May be strings ('t1') or datestrings
Header column = factor'or variable names

Output files may be specified as .txt or .csv and will have data in columns:
X   	Y   LS
f1	f2   -
f1	f3   -
Col 1 (X) = 'factor' or variable name 1
Col 2 (Y) = 'factor' or variable name 2
Col 3 (LS) = local similarity score
Col 9 (Delay) = delay index for the LS
